**Spring Framework Complete Guide (Zero to Pro)**

## **Introduction to Spring Framework**
Spring Framework is an open-source, lightweight framework for building enterprise applications in Java. It provides comprehensive support for developing Java applications with features such as dependency injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and transaction management.

### **Key Features of Spring Framework**
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Reduces tight coupling between components.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Helps in separating cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions.
- **Spring MVC:** Provides a powerful Model-View-Controller architecture for web applications.
- **Spring Boot:** Simplifies Java development with auto-configuration and embedded servers.
- **Spring Security:** Provides authentication and authorization features.
- **Spring Data:** Simplifies database access using JPA and other technologies.
- **Spring Cloud:** Supports microservices development with distributed system capabilities.

## **History of Spring Framework**
- **2002:** Created by Rod Johnson and released as part of his book "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development."
- **2004:** First official version of the Spring Framework released.
- **2014:** Spring Boot introduced for rapid application development.
- **2017-Present:** Spring 5 and 6 introduced, providing reactive programming support and native cloud capabilities.

## **Why Use Spring Framework?**
Spring Framework is widely used because:
- It simplifies Java enterprise application development.
- It provides powerful integrations with various technologies like Hibernate, JPA, and Kafka.
- It supports microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
- It reduces boilerplate code with dependency injection and annotations.

### **Comparison with Other Frameworks**
| Feature      | Spring | Java EE | Struts | Play Framework |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Performance | High   | Moderate | High   | Very High |
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Hard | Moderate | Moderate |
| Microservices Support | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Built-in Security | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

## **Spring Architecture**
Spring Framework follows a layered architecture that consists of:
1. **Spring Core** – Provides dependency injection (DI) features.
2. **Spring AOP** – Implements aspect-oriented programming for modular code.
3. **Spring JDBC & ORM** – Supports database interaction.
4. **Spring MVC** – Provides a framework for web applications.
5. **Spring Security** – Ensures authentication and authorization.
6. **Spring Boot** – Simplifies Spring-based applications.

## **Spring Core Concepts**
### **1. Dependency Injection (DI)**
DI is a design pattern that reduces dependency between components by injecting dependencies at runtime.
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    
    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
### **2. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
AOP helps in separating cross-cutting concerns such as logging and security.
```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Executing: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }
}
```

---

## **Spring Boot**
Spring Boot is an extension of Spring that simplifies application development.
### **Key Features:**
- Embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
- Auto-configuration.
- Standalone applications.
- Spring Boot starters (pre-configured dependencies).

### **Creating a Spring Boot Application**
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

## **Spring MVC**
Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications following the Model-View-Controller pattern.
### **Spring MVC Controller Example**
```java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Welcome to Spring MVC");
        return "home";
    }
}
```

---

## **Spring Security**
Spring Security provides authentication and authorization features.
### **Spring Security Configuration**
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/").permitAll().anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and().formLogin().loginPage("/login").permitAll();
    }
}
```

---

## **Spring Data**
Spring Data simplifies database interaction using JPA and Hibernate.
### **Spring Data JPA Repository Example**
```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findByName(String name);
}
```

---

## **Spring Cloud**
Spring Cloud provides tools for building microservices.
### **Key Features:**
- Service Discovery (Eureka)
- API Gateway (Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway)
- Distributed Configuration (Spring Cloud Config)

---

## **Spring Framework Interview Questions**
### **Basic Questions**
1. What is Spring Framework?
   - A lightweight framework for Java enterprise applications.
2. What are the main modules of Spring Framework?
   - Spring Core, Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data.

### **Intermediate Questions**
3. What is dependency injection?
   - It’s a design pattern that injects dependencies at runtime instead of hardcoding them.
4. What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository`?
   - `@Component` is a generic annotation, `@Service` is for business logic, `@Repository` is for database operations.

### **Advanced Questions**
5. What is Spring Boot auto-configuration?
   - A mechanism that automatically configures Spring application based on dependencies.
6. How does Spring Security handle authentication?
   - It uses `UserDetailsService` and `AuthenticationManager` to manage user credentials.
