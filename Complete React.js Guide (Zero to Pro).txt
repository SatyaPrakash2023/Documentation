**Complete React.js Guide (Zero to Pro)**

## **Introduction to React.js**
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). It is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.

### **Key Features of React.js**
- **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is split into reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Enhances performance by minimizing real DOM manipulations.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: Ensures predictable state changes.
- **React Hooks**: Allow functional components to manage state.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: Syntax extension for writing HTML inside JavaScript.
- **React Router**: Enables navigation without reloading the page.

## **Why Use React.js?**
React.js is preferred for:
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**
- **Dynamic Web Applications**
- **Cross-Platform Mobile Apps (React Native)**
- **SEO-friendly Web Applications**

### **Comparison with Other Frontend Technologies**
| Feature        | React.js    | Angular  | Vue.js   |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Performance   | High       | Moderate | High     |
| Learning Curve | Moderate  | Steep    | Easy     |
| Data Binding  | One-way    | Two-way  | Two-way  |
| Component-Based | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      |

## **Setting Up React.js**
### **Installing React using Create-React-App**
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

### **Setting Up React with Vite**
```sh
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## **Understanding JSX**
JSX allows writing HTML elements inside JavaScript.
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

---

## **Components in React.js**
### **Functional Component**
```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
export default Greeting;
```

### **Class Component**
```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}
export default Greeting;
```

## **State and Props in React**
### **Using State in a Functional Component (Hooks)**
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Counter;
```

### **Props Example**
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
<Welcome name="John" />;
```

## **React Interview Questions and Answers**
### **Basic Questions**
1. **What is React.js?**  
   React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where UI updates dynamically without refreshing the page.

2. **Explain Virtual DOM.**  
   The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, then calculates the differences and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, improving performance.

3. **What are props in React?**  
   Props (short for properties) are used to pass data between components. They are immutable and help maintain unidirectional data flow.

4. **What is the difference between state and props?**  
   - **Props** are read-only and passed from parent to child components.  
   - **State** is managed within the component and can be changed dynamically.

### **Intermediate Questions**
5. **What are React Hooks? Name a few.**  
   React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Examples: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`.

6. **Explain `useEffect` and how it works.**  
   `useEffect` is used for handling side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulations, or timers.

7. **What is Context API?**  
   The Context API is a built-in React feature that allows global state management without prop drilling.

8. **What is React Router?**  
   React Router is a library for handling client-side routing in React applications without page reloads.

### **Advanced Questions**
9. **How does reconciliation work in React?**  
   React uses the diffing algorithm to compare Virtual DOM versions and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM for efficiency.

10. **How does React handle performance optimization?**  
    - Using React.memo for component memoization.
    - Implementing lazy loading with `React.lazy()`.
    - Using keys in lists to help with efficient updates.

11. **Explain the use of Redux in React.**  
    Redux is a state management library used to manage application-wide state. It helps avoid prop drilling by providing a global store.

12. **How do you handle authentication in React?**  
    - Using Firebase or Auth0 for authentication.
    - Storing authentication tokens in local storage or context.
    - Implementing protected routes using React Router.
